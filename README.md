### Introduction

This Flutter project is built following the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and uses the Stacked architecture to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. The project demonstrates best practices for structuring a Flutter app, managing state, and handling business logic.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- IDE (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ, Android Studio) with Flutter and Dart plugins

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-ddd-stacked.git
   cd flutter-ddd-stacked
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate Code**

   This project uses code generation for dependency injection and routing. Run the following command to generate necessary files:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Run the App**

   Use the following command to run the app on a connected device or emulator:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Debugging**

   You can debug the app using your preferred IDE's debugging tools.

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
flutter build apk   # For Android
flutter build ios   # For iOS
```

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**

   The project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the business logic. Run the tests using the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**

   To run integration tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
   ```
